# Function is_palindrome that takes a string and checks if the text reads the same forwards and backwards.
# Any differences in uppercase/lowercase letters, spaces, punctuation, etc. should be ignored by using stringutils.normalize.
# Create a main function that runs when the program starts.
# Let main display a menu that initially only offers the option to check if a word is a palindrome.
# Main should utilize the functions in menu.py.
# Feel free to use match..case to handle the user's menu choice.
# The user should also be able to enter the string to be checked.
